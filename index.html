        <h1>Advancing Scholarship in Legal Studies</h1>
        <p>
          <p><h4>The Journal of Legal Studies (JLS) (ISSN 2343-4724) is a double-blind peer-reviewed international journal dedicated to promoting scholarly exchange among teachers and researchers in the field of law. The journal is published in online version by the jls.pruna.eu. The scope of JLS includes but is not limited to the following fields: legal history, legal theory, private and public international law, constitutional and administrative law, criminal law, civil law, commercial law, intellectual property law, technology law, cyber law, and procedural law. Authors are encouraged to submit complete, unpublished, original, and full-length articles that are not under review in any other journals.
</p>
In addition to its broad legal focus, JLS is deeply committed to advancing research in the field of child protection. The journal dedicates a significant portion of its mission to addressing the issues surrounding Finnish child protection practices, particularly those that critique arbitrary and profit-driven approaches. As part of its collaboration with the Research Center for Child Protection, JLS aims to highlight and challenge these practices, fostering discussions that promote ethical, child-centered reform in this critical area of law.
